    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will be fine tuning a transformer model for the **Multiclass text classification** problem. \n",
    "This is one of the most common business problems where a given piece of text/sentence/document needs to be classified into one of the categories out of the given list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Flow of the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook will be divided into seperate sections to provide a organized walk through for the process used. This process can be modified for individual use cases. The sections are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Importing Python Libraries and preparing the environment](#section01)\n",
    "2. [Importing and Pre-Processing the domain data](#section02)\n",
    "3. [Preparing the Dataset and Dataloader](#section03)\n",
    "4. [Creating the Neural Network for Fine Tuning](#section04)\n",
    "5. [Fine Tuning the Model](#section05)\n",
    "6. [Validating the Model Performance](#section06)\n",

    "This script leverages on multiple tools designed by other teams. Details of the tools used below. Please ensure that these elements are present in your setup to successfully implement this script.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Data: \n",
    "\t - We are using the News aggregator dataset available at by [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/News+Aggregator)\n",
    "\t - We are referring only to the first csv file from the data dump: `newsCorpora.csv`\n",
    "\t - There are `422937` rows of data.  Where each row has the following data-point: \n",
    "\t\t - ID Numeric ID  \n",
    "\t\t - TITLE News title  \n",
    "\t\t - URL Url  \n",
    "\t\t - PUBLISHER Publisher name  \n",
    "\t\t - CATEGORY News category (b = business, t = science and technology, e = entertainment, m = health)  \n",
    "\t\t - STORY Alphanumeric ID of the cluster that includes news about the same story  \n",
    "\t\t - HOSTNAME Url hostname  \n",
    "\t\t - TIMESTAMP Approximate time the news was published, as the number of milliseconds since the epoch 00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Language Model Used:\n",
    "\t - DistilBERT this is a smaller transformer model as compared to BERT or Roberta. It is created by process of distillation applied to Bert. \n",
    "\t - [Blog-Post](https://medium.com/huggingface/distilbert-8cf3380435b5)\n",

    "     - [Documentation for python](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/distilbert.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Hardware Requirements:\n",
    "\t - Python 3.6 and above\n",
    "\t - Pytorch, Transformers and All the stock Python ML Libraries\n",
    "\t - GPU enabled setup \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Script Objective:\n",
    "\t - The objective of this script is to fine tune DistilBERT to be able to classify a news headline into the following categories:\n",

This is needed because all the data from the dataset cannot be loaded to the memory at once, hence the amount of dataloaded to the memory and then passed to the neural network needs to be controlled.\n",
